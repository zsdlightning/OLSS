Due to the data privacy issues, we cannot release the data/code related to Yahoo! Ads platforms. However, we publish the code
for the text classfication tasks, including Rcv1 and news20. 

The data is too big to be uploaded into github. The data can be downloaded from 
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/data/olss-data.tgz

Note the "vw" folder contains the executable vw software in Linux. This can also be downloaded from  http://finance.yendor.com/ML/VW/Binaries/

To run the code, clone the project. Then download and extract the data in parallel to the folder "OLSS". Follow README to run the code in OLSS folder.
