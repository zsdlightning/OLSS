This fold is for testing OLSS on Rcv1 dataset
there is a subfolder "ftrl" --- it contains the scripts for tuning ftrl (implemented in Vowpal Wabbit software)

Raw Data: ../../data/rcv1/
training file: ../../data/rcv1/rcv1.train.vw
test file: ../../data/rcv1/rcv1.test.vw

Preprocessed files:
feature_to_id.txt: feature name (vw) to ID
mean_std_continuous_features.txt: mean & std for continuous features
feature_appearence_pos.npy, feature_appearence_neg.npy: feature count in postive/negative examples in training data

Source Code
get_feature_mapping_and_appearance.py: from data file with VW input-format, generate feature_to_id.txt, feature_appearence_pos.npy, feature_appearence_neg.npy
olss.py, OLSS algorithm for testing Rcv1

Running:
    Step 1: first go to ParamChoice folder, to find out the best parameter tau0
    Step 2: go back, and edit line 847 in olss.py, set tau0 with the best value
    Step 3: test OLSS with different sparsity levels rhp0
        python olss.py <rho0>

    Then from "logger-rcv1.txt", you can find out the results.
